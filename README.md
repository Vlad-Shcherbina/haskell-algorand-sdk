# Algorand (`haskell-algorand-sdk`)

A Haskell SDK for the Algorand blockchain.

Tools for working with transactions on the Algorand blockchain
and interacting with algod through its REST API.


## Use

### As a library

* Add `algorand-sdk` as a dependency to your packge.
* Follow the documentation and have a look at the example CLI app.

### As a CLI tool

* Install `algorand-sdk` using your favourite Haskell package manager.
* The binary will be called `halgo`.

#### Creating an account

Use `halgo acc new <file>` to create a new account and save its key to the file:

```text
$ halgo acc new ./example.acc
HNVCPPGOW2SC2YVDVDICU3YNONSTEFLXDXREHJR2YBEKDC2Z3IUZSC6YGI
```

It prints the address of your account. You can view the address anytime
using `halgo acc show <file>`:

```text
$ halgo acc show ./example.acc
HNVCPPGOW2SC2YVDVDICU3YNONSTEFLXDXREHJR2YBEKDC2Z3IUZSC6YGI
```

You can use the address to top-up your account
(for example, using the [faucet] on Testnet).

[faucet]: https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/

#### Talking to a node

`halgo` can talk to `algod` using its REST API. The commands for talking
to a node all start with `halgo node`.

* Use `--network` to choose what network (genesis ID) to connect to.
* Use `--url` to give the URL of the API of the node.
* If network is one of the well-known public ones (`mainnet-v1.0`,
  `testnet-v1.0`, `betanet-v1.0`), giving URL is optional as AlgoExplorer
  nodes will be used by default.
*  `--network` is `testnet-v1.0` by default.

Use `algo node url` to see the URL of the chosen node:

```text
$ halgo node url
https://api.testnet.algoexplorer.io/

$ halgo --network mainnet-v1.0 node url
https://api.algoexplorer.io/

$ halgo --network mainnet-v1.0 node --url https://example.com/ url
https://example.com/
```

Use `halgo node version` to get basic information about the node:

```text
$ halgo node version
{
    "genesis_hash_b64": "SGO1GKSzyE7IEPItTxCByw9x8FmnrCDexi9/cOUJOiI=",
    "build": {
        "minor": 4,
        "channel": "stable",
        "major": 2,
        "commit_hash": "573a34c4",
        "branch": "rel/stable",
        "build_number": 1
    },
    "versions": [
        "v1",
        "v2"
    ],
    "genesis_id": "testnet-v1.0"
}
```

#### Check your balance

`halgo node fetch` queries node for information about an account. The output
is formatted as JSON. Here is an easy way to check your balance:

```text
$ halgo node fetch HNVCPPGOW2SC2YVDVDICU3YNONSTEFLXDXREHJR2YBEKDC2Z3IUZSC6YGI | jq '.amount'
100000000
```
